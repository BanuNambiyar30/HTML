    <p>A butterfly is an insect with wings that are very beautiful and mesmerizing. We can observe different colors and patterns in the wings. A butterfly generally consists of 6 thin legs along with two antennas. There are three parts of the body in a butterfly, typically the head, the main body, and the tail.</p>
